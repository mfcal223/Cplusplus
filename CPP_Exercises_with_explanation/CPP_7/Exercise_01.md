## TASK  

> This exercise focuses on applying a generic operation to each element of an array without knowing the array’s element type in advance.

Implement a function template named `iter` that applies a given function to each element of an array.  

The function must take three parameters:
1. A pointer to the first element of an array  
2. The number of elements in the array (passed as a constant value)  
3. A function that will be executed on each element of the array

The iter function itself returns nothing.  

* Requirements:  
    * The function must work with arrays of any type  
    * The function passed as the third argument may:  
        * Take elements by non-const reference (to modify them)
        * Or by const reference (to read them only)
    * Your implementation must support both const and non-const arrays  
    * All template code must be placed in the header file  
    * A main.cpp must be provided with meaningful tests

---

## What is the exercise REALLY about?

This exercise is not about arrays, but it is about designing a generic interface that respects const-correctness.  
This is compile-time safety, not runtime checking.  

`iter` abstracts the idea of: `“Apply the same operation to every element in a sequence.” ` and this needs to work for int[], std::string[], and any other future type.  

### Const vs Non-Const

***THIS is the tricly part of iter.***  
Using a function (3rd parameter) that modifies the data in the array must NOT work for a const arr[].  

If the function is a read-only operation, it will work both with const and non-const arr[]
```c++
void printInt(int const &x)
{
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
```

BUT this one: 

```c++
void increment(int &x)
{
    x++;
}

```

This should work with int arr[] but **must NOT** with const int arr[] because modifying const data is forbidden.  

This means:
* You cannot force everything to be non-const.  
* You cannot strip constness.  
* You must let the compiler enforce correctness.  

|    iter must NOT decide:   |  iter must ONLY:         |
|-------|-----------|
|whether elements are const | iterate |
| whether they can be modified | forward elements exactly as they are |

> Templates do not enforce rules — they propagate them.

* If the array is const → only const functions will compile.  
* If the array is non-const → both kinds may compile.  
`The compiler enforces this for you`.

## Designing Iter.hpp

`Step A — What iter must do`

- Receive a pointer to the first element of an array
- Receive the array length
- Call a function on each element
- Work for any element type
- Work for const arrays and non-const arrays
- Allow the callback to accept either:
    - T& (modifiable)
    - T const& (read-only)

`Step B — The key design decision`

A simple solution (c++98 friendly)

✅ Provide two overloads:
```
iter(T* array, ...) → gives elements as T&

iter(T const* array, ...) → gives elements as T const&
```

This automatically enforces:
* const arrays can’t be modified
* non-const arrays can

`Step C — The callback type`

We’ll accept a function pointer:
* For non-const:
```
void (*f)(T&)

void (*f)(T const&) (also allowed)
```
* For const:
```
void (*f)(T const&)
```

> Why 3 overloads (and not 2)?  
> Because you need to cover the 3 possible combinations: 
> Non const array - non const function
> Non const array - const function
> Const array - const function

## Const / non-const flow diagram (mental model)

“Constness flows from the array pointer type into the element reference type, and the compiler checks callback compatibility.”

       YES: compiles            NO: compile error
       and runs                (const correctness enforced)
```
