## 📬 TASK  

> This exercise focuses on applying a generic operation to each element of an array without knowing the array’s element type in advance.

Implement a function template named `iter` that applies a given function to each element of an array.  

The function must take three parameters:
1. A pointer to the first element of an array  
2. The number of elements in the array (passed as a constant value)  
3. A function that will be executed on each element of the array

The iter function itself returns nothing.  

* Requirements:  
    * The function must work with arrays of any type  
    * The function passed as the third argument may:  
        * Take elements by non-const reference (to modify them)
        * Or by const reference (to read them only)
    * Your implementation must support both const and non-const arrays  
    * All template code must be placed in the header file  
    * A main.cpp must be provided with meaningful tests

---

## 🔍 What is the exercise REALLY about?

This exercise is not about arrays, but it is about designing a generic interface that respects const-correctness.  
This is compile-time safety, not runtime checking.  

`iter` abstracts the idea of: `“Apply the same operation to every element in a sequence.” ` and this needs to work for int[], std::string[], and any other future type.  

### 📍 Const vs Non-Const

***THIS is the tricly part of iter.***  
*Using a function (3rd parameter) that modifies the data in the array must NOT work for a const arr[].*  
*If the function is a read-only operation, it will work both with const and non-const arr[].*  

```c++
void printInt(int const &x)
{
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
```

**BUT this one:** 

```c++
void increment(int &x)
{
    x++;
}

```

This should work with `int arr[]` but **must NOT** with `const int arr[]` because modifying `const data` is **forbidden**. 💣 

This means:
* You cannot force everything to be non-const.  
* You cannot strip constness.  
* You must let the compiler enforce correctness.  

|    iter() must NOT decide:   |  iter() must ONLY:         |
|-------|-----------|
|whether elements are const | iterate |
| whether they can be modified | forward elements exactly as they are |

> Templates do not enforce rules — they propagate them.

* If the array is const → only const functions will compile.  
* If the array is non-const → both kinds may compile.  
📌 `The compiler enforces this for you`.

## Designing Iter.hpp

### ❓ What iter must do?

- Work for any element type **>>> it has to be a template**
- Receive a pointer to the first element of an array
    - Work for const arrays and non-const arrays
- Receive the array length
- Call a function on each element
    - Allow the function to accept either:
        - T& (modifiable)
        - T const& (read-only)

### 📑 Overloading iter function templates

Use what was learned in preivous modules! Overloading! 

```
iter(T* array, ...) → 🔎 gives elements as [T&]

iter(T const* array, ...) → 🔎 gives elements as [T const&]
```
This automatically enforces:
* **const arrays can’t be modified**
* **non-const arrays** ***can***

### 📑 The callback type

We’ll accept a function pointer:
* For non-const:
```
void (*f)(T&)

void (*f)(T const&) (also allowed)
```
* For const:
```
void (*f)(T const&)
```

⚠️ **Why 3 overloads (and not 2 or 4)?**  
Because you need to cover the `3 possible combinations`:   
✳️ Non const array - non const function  
✳️ Non const array - const function  
✳️ Const array - const function  

🛟 Consider if `Const array - non const function` is possible ... ☠️

## 🔮 Const / non-const flow diagram (mental model)

“Constness flows from the array pointer type into the element reference type, and the compiler checks callback compatibility.”
