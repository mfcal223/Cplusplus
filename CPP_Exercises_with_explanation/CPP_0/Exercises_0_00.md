# C++ Module 0 - Exercise 00 - Fixate OOP core concepts 

## TASK
Create a program called megaphone, along with a corresponding Makefile to compile it.  
The program must print the uppercase version of all input arguments received.  
If no arguments are provided, it must instead display a default warning message.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
- The Makefile must include the rules: all, clean, fclean, and re. It must not relink if no source files changed.  
- End every output with a newline character.
- Use C++98-compatible syntax and standard libraries only.  

üí° Guiding questions  
- What standard C++ headers should be included to access output streams and character manipulation?  
- What built-in functions help convert characters to uppercase? What type do they return?  
- What‚Äôs the proper syntax for printing to the standard output?  
- Do we need to explicitly include a newline "\n" or use std::endl? Why does it matter?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>

int main(int ac, char **av)
{
	int	i;
	int j;
	
	if (ac == 1)
		std::cout << "* I forgot what I was trying to say *" << std::endl;
	else
	{
		for (i = 1; i < ac; i++)
		{
			j = 0;
			while (av[i][j])
			{
				std::cout << static_cast<char>(std::toupper(av[i][j]));
				j++;
			}
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return (0);
}
```

This exercise is quite concise. The key thing is to become familiarized with C++ syntax and the way functions are called.
