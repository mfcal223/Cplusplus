# Cplusplus
Introduction to the use of C++, following simple exercises. The goal is to learn about Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

This repository will contain key concepts for c++ beginners. 

Every exercise will be based on C++98 standard, adn therefore will compile with `c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.

There will be no external libraries.  
No printf/malloc/free. Instead, it will use C++ alternatives like cout, new, etc.
Also I will not use namespace or friend, STL containers or algorithms.

This repository contains **theory notes** and **detailed explanations** of some exercises on **C++ basic concepts**.    
➡️ The **code** is kept in a separate private repository – this repo is focused only on documentation.
