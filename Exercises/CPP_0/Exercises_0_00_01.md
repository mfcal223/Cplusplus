# List of Exercises to fixate OOP core concepts 

## level 0 

### exercise 00
Create a program called megaphone, along with a corresponding Makefile to compile it.  
The program must print the uppercase version of all input arguments received.  
If no arguments are provided, it must instead display a default warning message.  

⚠️ Requirements
- The Makefile must include the rules: all, clean, fclean, and re. It must not relink if no source files changed.  
- End every output with a newline character.
- Use C++98-compatible syntax and standard libraries only.  

💡 Guiding questions  
- What standard C++ headers should be included to access output streams and character manipulation?  
- What built-in functions help convert characters to uppercase? What type do they return?  
- What’s the proper syntax for printing to the standard output?  
- Do we need to explicitly include a newline "\n" or use std::endl? Why does it matter?

int main(int ac, char **av)
{
	int	i;
	int j;
	
	if (ac == 1)
		std::cout << "* I forgot what I was trying to say *" << std::endl;
	else
	{
		for (i = 1; i < ac; i++)
		{
			j = 0;
			while (av[i][j])
			{
				std::cout << static_cast<char>(std::toupper(av[i][j]));
				j++;
			}
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return (0);
}
```

### exercise 01
Create a command-line PhoneBook program using C++ classes.
It must be able to store, search, and display up to `8 contacts`, all managed in memory without dynamic allocation.

On launch, the program should wait for the user to type one of the following commands:  
- ADD → Add a new contact  
- SEARCH → Display a contact list and allow selecting one  
- EXIT → Quit the program    

📌 Requirements  
📇 Program must use two classes: PhoneBook and Contact.  
📇 All contacts must be stored using an array — not dynamic memory allocation (no new, no malloc).  
📇 When a 9th contact is added, the oldest one should be replaced.  
📇 Class members should be private where appropriate.  
📇 Input/output must be managed using std::cin and std::cout.  

📖 Behavior rules  
Each contact must contain:  
📓 First name  
📓 Last name  
📓 Nickname  
📓 Phone number  
📓 Darkest secret  
📍 `(None of these fields can be empty.)`  

🔎 When SEARCH is called:  
- A table displays the index, first name, last name, and nickname of all saved contacts.  
- Each column must be exactly 10 characters wide.  
- If the text is longer than 10, truncate and replace the last character with a dot ..  
- All columns must be right-aligned.  
- After the table, the user is prompted to input an index.  
- If the input is valid, display the full contact information.  
- If not, show an appropriate error or fallback behavior.  
- After executing any command (except EXIT), the program must wait for another command.  

🧠 Guiding questions  
- How are you going to organize your file structure? (you need *.hpp and *.cpp)
- How can you format columns to a fixed width using stream manipulators?  
- What kind of validation should you do on user input?  
- What are the benefits of using classes here?  
- Why does the contact list have a fixed size?  
- How can you track which contact to overwrite next?  

<details>
<summary>Click to expand information about file structure </summary>

```cpp
- Header = Think of the header file like a contract or blueprint — it tells the compiler:  
"Here’s the structure of this class, what it can do, and how it can be used."  

💡 Following best practice guideline where I study, No function implementation will be add in the header file. 

- cpp file = the cpp file is the actual construction — how you build it, fulfill that contract, and make it work.  

Contact.hpp  
- Class declaration  
- Private attributes: first name, last name, nickname, etc.  
- Public setters and getters  

Contact.cpp   
- Implementation of Contact methods (e.g., setFirstName(), displayInfo())  

PhoneBook.hpp  
- Class declaration
- Array of 8 Contact objects
- Index tracking  

PhoneBook.cpp  
- Implementation of PhoneBook methods  
- addContact()  
- displayTable()  
- searchContact()  

main.cpp
- Command loop (ADD, SEARCH, EXIT)
- Handles user input and calls methods on a PhoneBook instance

Makefile
- Compiles all .cpp files
- Links into a PhoneBook executable
- Includes all, clean, fclean, re rules
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>Click to expand information class declaration </summary>

```cpp
class Contact
{
private:					//ACTUAL DATA MEMBERS — 
    std::string firstName;	//the variables holding the contact's info.
    std::string lastName;

public:
    Contact();				// 👈 This is the default constructor
							//Without this constructor declared publicly, you wouldn't be able 
							// to create a Contact object like that.
    void setFirstName(const std::string &value);
    void setLastName(const std::string &value);
	/*These are setter functions. You use them to assign a value to the private attributes from outside the class.*/

    std::string getFirstName() const;
    std::string getLastName() const;
	/*These are getter functions. They return the value of the private variable, without letting you change it directly.*/

    void displayFullInfo() const;		//prints all the information of the contact.
};
```

* the `const` at the end of getters means “This function doesn’t change anything in the object.”
(Just reads data — it’s safe.)

# Phonebook files

## the flow inside addContact()

Right now you have something like:

cpp
Copiar
Editar
void PhoneBook::addContact() {
    Contact c;              // 1. Local temporary Contact created
    // ... set all its fields ...
    contacts[nextIndex] = c; // 2. Assign temp to the array slot
    // ...
} // 3. Local temp `c` goes out of scope here
2️⃣ Step-by-step
Step 1: Contact c;
This creates a local variable c inside the function.

It’s a full-fledged Contact object that lives on the stack.

Step 2: contacts[nextIndex] = c;
contacts is an array of already existing Contact objects.

Doing contacts[nextIndex] = c; does not create a new Contact in that slot.

Instead, it calls the copy assignment operator to copy the contents of c into the already existing Contact in the array.

Key point: The Contact in contacts[nextIndex] is not destroyed or replaced — it’s updated.

Step 3: End of addContact() scope
When the function finishes, the local Contact c goes out of scope.

Its destructor is called automatically.

That’s the "Contact destroyed" message you see immediately after Contact saved.

3️⃣ Why you see one here and many at the end
During ADD: Only the temporary c is destroyed.

At program exit: The PhoneBook object in main is destroyed, which causes its contacts[8] array to be destroyed — one destructor call for each element (even unused ones).

---

1. Private members in PhoneBook.hpp  
```cpp
Contact contacts[8];
int contactCount;
int nextIndex;
```

contacts[8] → The fixed-size array holding the 8 Contact objects (already exist when a PhoneBook is created).  

contactCount → Keeps track of how many contacts are currently stored (so we know how many are valid).   

nextIndex → Keeps track of which slot to overwrite next when adding a contact.    
	- Starts at 0.    
	- Increments each time we ADD.  
	- Wraps around to 0 after reaching 7 (using modulo % 8).  


2. Constructor initialization  
```cpp
PhoneBook::PhoneBook() : contactCount(0), nextIndex(0) {}  
: contactCount(0), nextIndex(0) is called a member initializer list. 
```

This sets both integers to 0 before the constructor body executes.  

Equivalent to:  

```cpp
PhoneBook::PhoneBook() {
    contactCount = 0;
    nextIndex = 0;
}
```
but the initializer list is considered better style for basic types.   

No body logic is needed here, so the braces are empty.  
---

## addContact() step-by-step

```cpp
void PhoneBook::addContact()
{
    Contact c;
```
Creates a local Contact object called c.  
This c will be filled with user-provided data and then stored in the contacts[] array.  

```cpp
    c.setFirstName(getNonEmptyInput("Enter first name: "));
    c.setLastName(getNonEmptyInput("Enter last name: "));
    c.setNickname(getNonEmptyInput("Enter nickname: "));
    //(...)
    c.setDarkestSecret(getNonEmptyInput("Enter darkest secret: "));

```
Calls our private helper function `getNonEmptyInput()` for each string field.

`getNonEmptyInput()` ensures the input is not empty before returning it.

```cpp
    c.setPhoneNumber(getPhoneNumberInput("Enter phone number: "));
``` 
Uses another helper, `getPhoneNumberInput()`, which ensures:
- Input is not empty  
- Every character is a digit  

Then it stores the new contact in the array at nextIndex.
```cpp
    contacts[nextIndex] = c;
    nextIndex = (nextIndex + 1) % 8;
```
`(nextIndex + 1) % 8` ensures the index wraps around after reaching the last slot (circular buffer).

```cpp
    if (contactCount < 8)
        contactCount++;
```
Only increases contactCount until it reaches the maximum (8).

```cpp
    std::cout << "Contact saved." << std::endl;
```
Confirms to the user that the contact was successfully saved.

### AddContact() helpers

#### getNonEmptyInput()

`std::string PhoneBook::getNonEmptyInput(const std::string &prompt) const`

- Private member function.  
- `const` means it won’t modify the phonebook’s state.  
- Takes a prompt message as a `const std::string&` (avoids copying).
- Uses a loop to keep asking until the user enters non-empty text.  
- `std::getline` is used to allow spaces in input.  
- Returns the validated string.  
 
#### getPhoneNumberInput()

`std::string PhoneBook::getPhoneNumberInput(const std::string &prompt) const`  

- Similar to getNonEmptyInput() but includes digit-only validation.  
- Includes a bool vari able `bool valid;` that will store the result of the validation check.   
- `site_t i` will be used for iterating through characters.  
- The manual while loop to ensure all characters are digits.  
- The `static_cast<unsigned char>` is needed because `std::isdigit()` expects an unsigned char or EOF — this avoids undefined behavior for negative char values.

## searchContacts() method

First, print the table header:  
```cpp
std::cout << "|     Index|First Name| Last Name|  Nickname|" << std::endl;
```

Then loop over stored contacts:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < contactCount; i++)
{
    std::cout << "|" << std::setw(10) << i
              << "|" << std::setw(10) << truncate(contacts[i].getFirstName())
              << "|" << std::setw(10) << truncate(contacts[i].getLastName())
              << "|" << std::setw(10) << truncate(contacts[i].getNickname())
              << "|" << std::endl;
}
```

Key new thing here: `std::setw(10)` which sets the minimum width for the next output field.

> If the value is shorter, it’s padded (by default with spaces) on the left → right-aligned text.

Combined with truncate(), this ensures each column is exactly 10 chars wide.

What happens in the loop:
`i` → index number (0 to contactCount - 1)

For each contact:
- Call the getter (getFirstName(), etc.)
- Pass result through truncate() so it fits in the table
- Use `std::setw(10)` to print it right-aligned in a 10-char column

Example output:

```yaml
|         0|      Maria|   Calciati|     FloFlo|
```

Prompt for index:
```cpp
std::cout << "Enter index to view full contact: ";
std::string input;
std::getline(std::cin, input);
```

Reads the whole line into input (even if the user types a space or presses Enter).

Convert index string to number:
```cpp
int index = -1;
if (input.length() == 1 && isdigit(input[0]))
    index = input[0] - '0';
```

Only accepts single-digit input ('0' to '9').

Show full contact or error:
```cpp
if (index >= 0 && index < contactCount)
    contacts[index].displayFullInfo();
else
    std::cout << "Invalid index." << std::endl;
```
If index is valid → display the full stored data (no truncation).
Else → print error.

---

## truncate() helper

```cpp
static std::string truncate(const std::string &str)
{
    if (str.length() > 10)
        return str.substr(0, 9) + ".";
    return str;
}
```

🔹 Purpose
Ensures that when printing strings in a fixed-width table (10 chars wide),
any string longer than 10 characters is shortened to first 9 characters + ..

🔹 Syntax & behavior
`static` here means the function is only visible in this .cpp file (not callable from other files).  
`const std::string &str` → pass-by-reference, no copy, and promise not to modify.
`str.length()` → returns the number of characters in the string.
`str.substr(0, 9)` → returns a substring from index 0 of length 9.
`+ "."` → appends a dot at the end to signal truncation.

If the string is 10 characters or less, return it unchanged.

Example:
```cpp
truncate("Alexanderson") → "Alexanders."
truncate("Maria")        → "Maria"
```
